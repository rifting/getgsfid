# getgsfid
A simple app to get the GSF ID (Google Services Framework ID). This is the "device ID" that Family Link and other Google apps use. Also my first android app! Made because I couldn't find a similar, barebones solution to getting this ID.

# Building
Simply build in Android studio. This was built using Android Studio Ladybug Feature Drop 2024.2.2, but should also work for the more recent Android studio versions.

Enjoy !
